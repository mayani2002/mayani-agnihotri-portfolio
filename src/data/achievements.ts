        description: "Won first place in a 72-hour hackathon with a team of 4 developers. For the problem statement Smart Waste Management System, we designed a prototype platform to bridge the gap between citizens, garbage collection trucks, and waste recycling companies. We developed a citizen dashboard enabling users to schedule garbage pickups by waste category, date, time, and location (via map or geolocation). To optimize logistics, we implemented TSP (Travelling Salesman Problem) and VRP (Vehicle Routing Problem) algorithms to plan efficient pickup routes, which were then displayed on the truck driversâ€™ dashboard using the Google Maps API.",
